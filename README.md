# NonlinearContinuumMechanics
This project aims to introduce hyperelasticity formulations. Currently the focus is on the Ogden hyperelastic formulation and on derivation of the stress from the strain energy density function. Equations of stress are derived for the special case of uniaxial boundary conditions for three types of formulations:
1. Constrained
2. Unconstrained (coupled)
3. Uncoupled 

In addition to the theoretical developments, numerical implementations are presented in the form of a [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) notebook featuring the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). In addition a basic MATLAB/[Octave](https://octave.org/) implementation in a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook is provided. These notebooks can be used in teaching showing theory and numerical implementation side-by-side.

## Companion presentation 
In addition to the above resources, this project features an informal companion presentation on the anatomy of the Ogden formulation. The presentation is available here in various formats (`.odp`, `ppt`, `.pdf`, and `.mp4`) in the [`assets/presentation`](https://github.com/Kevin-Mattheus-Moerman/NonlinearContinuumMechanics/blob/main/assets/presentation/) folder:
